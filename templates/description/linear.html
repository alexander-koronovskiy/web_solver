Linear Equation. Check the instruction

<p>A System of Linear Equations is when we have two or more linear equations working together.
    Only simple variables are allowed in linear equations. No x2, y3, √x, etc.
    A Linear Equation can be in 2 dimension or in 3 dimensions, or 4 dimension, or more.
    When the number of equations is the same as the number of variables there is likely to be a solution.
    Not guaranteed, but likely.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So a System of Equations could have many equations and many variables. There can be any combination:
    In fact there are only three possible cases: No solution, One solution, Infinitely many solutions.</p>

<p>In order to solve the system of equations, you can use the test version of the web solver.
    To avoid errors when using the service, follow three rules:</p>

<p>When writing down each next equation in the system, go to a new line
    When writing the equation, bring the equation to the form when the left side contains unique variables multiplied by the coefficients, and the right side contains free values ​​without variables.
    When writing a line of equation from the system - put spaces between signs, values ​​and coefficients.</p>

Here is an example of a system record:
<ul>
    <li>x + y = -3</li>
    <li>2x - 5y = 45</li>
</ul>
